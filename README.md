# waterfox-fedora-copr-ci

[Waterfox](https://github.com/BrowserWorks/waterfox) is an open-source, privacy-focused browser based on the popular open source browser with a red panda as a mascot. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for said browser that offers enhanced privacy features, performance improvements, and customizability while maintaining compatibility with existing extensions.

Thia repository uses a [RPM build spec](https://github.com/DeltaCopy/waterfox-fedora-copr-ci/blob/main/specs/waterfox.spec) for packaging files from https://cdn1.waterfox.net/releases on the Fedora COPR.

Building from src is a resource intensive process, and as a result this package uses the files from https://cdn.waterfox.com/waterfox/releases/

A GitHub actions workflow is scheduled to run daily at 12AM to check the latest version released from https://github.com/BrowserWorks/waterfox

If the latest version does not match the version available from the COPR then a new COPR build is triggered remotely.

The COPR project repository is available from: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/deltacopy/waterfox

## Active releases available

- Fedora 42
- Fedora 43
- Fedora rawhide
